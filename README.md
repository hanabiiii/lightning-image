# lightning-image

`lightning-image` is a Lightning Web Component specially designed to easily
optimize image loading. It's optimized for fixed width/height images and images that stretch the full-width of a container.

Using [Salesforce CRM Content thumbnail rendition servlet](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/04/building-content-rich-visualforce-pages-with-salesforce-crm-content.html) to optimize the thumbnail's size.

## Problem

Large, unoptimized images dramatically slow down your site.

But creating optimized images for websites has long been a thorny problem.
Ideally you would:

- Resize large images to the size needed by your design
- Generate multiple smaller images so smartphones and tablets don't download
  desktop-sized images
- Efficiently lazy load images to speed initial page load and save bandwidth
- Hold the image position so your page doesn't jump while images load

Doing this consistently across a site feels like sisyphean labor. You manually
optimize your images and thenâ€¦ several images are swapped in at the last minute
or a design-tweak shaves 100px of width off your images.

This isn't ideal. Optimized images should be easy and the default.

## Solution

`lightning-image` works seamlessly with [Salesforce CRM Content thumbnail rendition servlet](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2014/04/building-content-rich-visualforce-pages-with-salesforce-crm-content.html). To produce perfect images,
you need only:

1. Install `lightning-image` and use it in place of the built-in `img`
2. Write a controller to query the Content thumbnail
   which specify the fields needed by `lightning-image`.


## Install

There are two ways to install this component:

-   [Using a Scratch Org](#installing-to-your-org): This is the recommended installation option. Use this option if you are a developer who wants to experience the code.
-   [Using an Unmanaged Package](#installing-using-an-unmanaged-package): This option allows anybody to experience the sample app without installing a local development environment.

### Installing to your Org

1. Set up your environment. Follow the steps in the [Quick Start: Lightning Web Components](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quick-start-lightning-web-components/) Trailhead project. The steps include:

-   Install Salesforce CLI
-   Install Visual Studio Code
-   Install the Visual Studio Code Salesforce extensions, including the Lightning Web Components extension

2. If you haven't already done so, authenticate with your org

```
sfdx force:auth:web:login
```

3. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/hanabiiii/lightning-image.git
cd lightning-image
```

4. Deploy the component to your org:

```
sfdx force:source:deploy -m LightningComponentBundle:lightningImage -u [your-account]
```

## How to use

Please check the example component: [Case Attachments](/force-app/main/default/aura/CaseAttachments/CaseAttachments.cmp).

## Resolution switching

`lightning-image` supports showing different images at different breakpoints, which is known as [Resolution switching: Different sizes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images#Resolution_switching_Different_sizes).
